## üéâ Single-Page Application Successfully Created!
I've successfully converted your multi-page portfolio into a beautiful single-page application with automatic navigation highlighting. Here's what I implemented:

## üîß Key Features:

### 1. Single-Page Layout:
- **Home Section**: Hero area with your introduction and GitHub link
- **About Section**: Personal biography with professional journey and sports activities
- **Portfolio Section**: Project showcase with status indicators and tech tags

### 2. Active Navigation Highlighting:
- **Scroll Detection**: Navigation automatically highlights the current section as you scroll
- **Visual Feedback**: Active section gets highlighted background and bold text
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions for smooth highlighting changes

### 3. Smooth Scrolling:
- **JavaScript Scrolling**: Smooth scroll behavior when clicking navigation buttons
- **CSS Enhancement**: Added `scroll-behavior: smooth` for native smooth scrolling
- **Proper Offsets**: Navigation accounts for fixed header height

### 4. Enhanced UX:
- **Fixed Header**: Sticky navigation that follows you as you scroll
- **Scroll-to-Top Button**: Appears after scrolling down 300px
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all device sizes
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Theme switching preserved

## üì± Navigation Behavior:
